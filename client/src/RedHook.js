      <h4>
        A rockstar seeking a simpler life unexpectedly encounters his
        girlfriendâ€™s ex boyfriend for the first time, and after it takes an
        emotional turn, realizes he has to choose between his vocation or love.

      <h1>DIRECTORS STATEMENT</h1>
      <p>
        A fascination with meeting my girlfriend's long term ex boyfriend lead
        me to the question-- what if I ran into him? What if we sat down, and
        had a conversation? What would I learn? I know this man's most intimate
        secrets-- what a strange dynamic... And what an excellent place to
        explore our vulnerabilities. Well, my own vulnerabilities-- As a writer,
        I'm keenly aware that if you're deeply personal and expose yourself, you
        might have a chance of helping others with your words. What's difficult
        is when your parents/close friends beg to read your "diary
        confessions"... it's petrifying. I can't imagine what it's like being a
        famous musician having to experience this on a massive scale. But when
        we make the difficult choice to divulge our own insecurities, and don't
        feel the need to constantly put ourselves in the best light, we have an
        opportunity to grow. To move on. To share and revel in our
        vulnerabilities... it's all we can do
