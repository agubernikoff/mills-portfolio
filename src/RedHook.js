          After suddenly abandoning a world tour, rockstar Andrew Lane is now

      {/* <h1>DIRECTORS STATEMENT</h1>
      <p>
        A fascination with meeting my girlfriend's long term ex boyfriend lead
        me to the question-- what if I ran into him? What if we sat down, and
        had a conversation? What would I learn? I know this man's most intimate
        secrets-- what a strange dynamic...
        <br />
        <br /> And what an excellent place to explore our vulnerabilities. Well,
        my own vulnerabilities--
        <br />
        <br /> As a writer, I'm keenly aware that if you're deeply personal and
        expose yourself, you might have a chance of helping others with your
        words. What's difficult is when your parents/close friends beg to read
        your "diary confessions"... it's petrifying. I can't imagine what it's
        like being a famous musician having to experience this on a massive
        scale. <br />
        <br />
        But when we make the difficult choice to divulge our own insecurities,
        and don't feel the need to constantly put ourselves in the best light,
        we have an opportunity to grow. To move on. To share and revel in our
        vulnerabilities... it's all we can do
